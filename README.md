# My Programming Wiki

A simple wiki project for documenting my programming knowledge and notes.

The goal is to create a personal reference that I can easily access and update as I learn new concepts and techniques in programming.

## Tools
I am using the following tools to build and host this wiki:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - A fast and flexible static site generator.
- [Docsy Theme](https://www.docsy.dev/) - A documentation theme for Hugo
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting service for static websites directly from a GitHub repository. 
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) - Automate, customize, and execute software development workflows right in your repository.

After each commit to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build the site and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
